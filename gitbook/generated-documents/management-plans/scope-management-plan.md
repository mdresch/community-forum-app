# Scope Management Plan for Community Forum App Project

## 1. Introduction

This Scope Management Plan outlines the process for defining, managing, and controlling project scope for the Community Forum App project. The project aims to create a user-friendly community forum platform that allows real-time discussions and collaborations among users.

## 2. Scope Management Approach

The approach to scope management will be guided by the PMBOK framework, ensuring that all scope-related processes are systematically executed. This plan will cover the following processes:

1. **Plan Scope Management**
2. **Collect Requirements**
3. **Define Scope**
4. **Create WBS (Work Breakdown Structure)**
5. **Validate Scope**
6. **Control Scope**

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Project Manager**: Responsible for overseeing the scope management process, ensuring all scope-related activities align with project goals.
- **Business Analyst**: Responsible for collecting and analyzing requirements from stakeholders.
- **Development Team**: Responsible for implementing the defined project scope.
- **Quality Assurance**: Responsible for validating the completed deliverables against the defined scope.
- **Stakeholders**: Provide input and feedback throughout the project lifecycle.

## 4. Plan Scope Management

### 4.1 Scope Management Process

The Scope Management Plan will be reviewed and approved by key stakeholders at the start of the project. Any changes to the scope management process will require stakeholder approval.

### 4.2 Tools and Techniques

- **Change Control System**: To manage scope changes.
- **Requirements Management Tools**: For tracking and documenting requirements.

## 5. Collect Requirements

### 5.1 Requirements Gathering Techniques

- **Interviews**: Conduct one-on-one interviews with key stakeholders.
- **Workshops**: Facilitate group meetings to brainstorm and gather requirements.
- **Surveys**: Distribute questionnaires to collect input from a broader audience.
- **Prototyping**: Develop mockups of the app for stakeholders to visualize and provide feedback.

### 5.2 Documenting Requirements

Requirements will be documented in a Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) to ensure that all requirements are tracked throughout the project lifecycle.

## 6. Define Scope

### 6.1 Project Scope Statement

The project scope statement will include:

- **Project Objectives**: To develop a community forum app that enables users to connect, share ideas, and engage in discussions.
- **Deliverables**: 
  - User authentication and registration features
  - Real-time chat functionality
  - User profile management
  - Community guidelines and moderation tools
  - Integration with v0.dev for deployment and syncing
- **Exclusions**: 
  - Mobile app development (focus will be on web platform)
  - Advanced analytics features (to be considered in future iterations)
- **Constraints**: 
  - Budget limitations
  - Timeline constraints (project completion by Q2 2025)
- **Assumptions**: 
  - All stakeholders will be available for feedback and requirements gathering.

### 6.2 Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance criteria will be defined for each deliverable, which will outline the conditions under which the deliverable will be accepted:

- Functionality meets specified requirements
- User interface is intuitive and user-friendly
- No critical bugs upon completion of testing

## 7. Create WBS

A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) will be created to break down project deliverables into manageable tasks. The WBS will be structured hierarchically and include:

1. Project Initiation
   - Kick-off Meeting
   - Stakeholder Identification
2. Requirements Gathering
   - Conduct Interviews
   - Facilitate Workshops
3. Design Phase
   - UI/UX Design
   - Prototype Development
4. Development Phase
   - Backend Development
   - Frontend Development
5. Testing Phase
   - Unit Testing
   - User Acceptance Testing
6. Deployment
   - Final Deployment on Vercel
   - User Training
7. Project Closure
   - Documentation
   - Lessons Learned

## 8. Validate Scope

### 8.1 Scope Verification

Each deliverable will undergo a formal review process with stakeholders to ensure it meets the defined acceptance criteria. This will involve:

- Demonstrating the functionality to stakeholders
- Collecting feedback and making necessary adjustments

## 9. Control Scope

### 9.1 Change Management Process

Any changes to the project scope will be managed through a formal change control process that includes:

1. **Change Request Submission**: Stakeholders submit a change request form.
2. **Impact Analysis**: Assess the impact of the change on project timeline, budget, and resources.
3. **Approval or Rejection**: The Change Control Board (CCB) will review and approve or reject the change.
4. **Documentation**: All approved changes will be documented and communicated to all stakeholders.

### 9.2 Monitoring Scope

The project manager will regularly review project progress against the defined scope and WBS to ensure that the project remains on track. Any deviations will be addressed promptly.

## 10. Conclusion

This Scope Management Plan provides a comprehensive framework for managing the scope of the Community Forum App project. By adhering to this plan, the project team will be equipped to effectively define, manage, and control the project scope, ensuring successful delivery of the app that meets stakeholder expectations.
