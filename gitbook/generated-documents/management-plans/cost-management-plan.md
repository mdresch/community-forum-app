## 2. Cost Management Approach

### 2.1 Cost Estimation
- **Methodology**: The project will utilize a bottom-up estimation approach, breaking down project components into smaller, manageable parts for accurate cost estimation.
- **Tools and Techniques**:
  - Analogous Estimating: Using historical data from similar projects.
  - Parametric Estimating: Applying statistical relationships between historical data and other variables.
  - Expert Judgment: Consulting with stakeholders and experts for cost insights.

### 2.2 Cost Budgeting
- **Establishing a Budget**: The project manager will compile cost estimates, categorize them into different types (development, deployment, marketing, etc.), and create a cost baseline for the project.
- **WBS (Work Breakdown Structure)**: The project will utilize a WBS to identify all work components and associated costs, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all project expenses.

### 2.3 Cost Control
- **Monitoring**: The project team will monitor costs against the cost baseline using Earned Value Management (EVM) techniques.
- **Reporting**: The Project Manager will produce monthly cost reports detailing actual vs. planned costs, variances, and forecasts for the remaining project duration.
- **Change Control**: Any changes to the project scope impacting costs must be documented and approved through the change control process.
