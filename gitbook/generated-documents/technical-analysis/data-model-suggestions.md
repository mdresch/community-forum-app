To design comprehensive data models for a community forum app, we need to consider the key entities involved in the forum's functionality. Below are the suggested data models, including their attributes and relationships.

### 1. User Model
This model captures the data related to the users of the forum.

- **User**
  - `user_id` (Primary Key, Unique Identifier)
  - `username` (String, Unique)
  - `email` (String, Unique)
  - `password_hash` (String)
  - `created_at` (Timestamp)
  - `updated_at` (Timestamp)
  - `profile_picture_url` (String)
  - `bio` (Text)
  - `role` (Enum: Admin, Moderator, Member)

### 2. Post Model
This model captures information about the posts made in the forum.

- **Post**
  - `post_id` (Primary Key, Unique Identifier)
  - `user_id` (Foreign Key to User)
  - `title` (String)
  - `content` (Text)
  - `created_at` (Timestamp)
  - `updated_at` (Timestamp)
  - `is_published` (Boolean)
  - `views` (Integer, Default: 0)
  - `category_id` (Foreign Key to Category)

### 3. Comment Model
This model captures comments made on posts.

- **Comment**
  - `comment_id` (Primary Key, Unique Identifier)
  - `post_id` (Foreign Key to Post)
  - `user_id` (Foreign Key to User)
  - `content` (Text)
  - `created_at` (Timestamp)
  - `updated_at` (Timestamp)
  - `is_deleted` (Boolean, Default: False)

### 4. Category Model
This model is for categorizing posts.

- **Category**
  - `category_id` (Primary Key, Unique Identifier)
  - `name` (String, Unique)
  - `description` (Text)
  - `created_at` (Timestamp)
  - `updated_at` (Timestamp)

### 5. Tag Model
Tags allow for further classification of posts and can be used to filter content.

- **Tag**
  - `tag_id` (Primary Key, Unique Identifier)
  - `name` (String, Unique)
  - `created_at` (Timestamp)
  - `updated_at` (Timestamp)

### 6. PostTag Model
This is a many-to-many relationship between posts and tags.

- **PostTag**
  - `post_id` (Foreign Key to Post)
  - `tag_id` (Foreign Key to Tag)
  - (Primary Key: Combination of `post_id` and `tag_id`)

### 7. Like Model
This model is for tracking likes on posts and comments.

- **Like**
  - `like_id` (Primary Key, Unique Identifier)
  - `user_id` (Foreign Key to User)
  - `post_id` (Foreign Key to Post, Nullable)
  - `comment_id` (Foreign Key to Comment, Nullable)
  - `created_at` (Timestamp)
  
### 8. Notification Model
This model tracks notifications for users (e.g., comments on a post, replies, etc.).

- **Notification**
  - `notification_id` (Primary Key, Unique Identifier)
  - `user_id` (Foreign Key to User)
  - `type` (Enum: Comment, Like, Mention)
  - `message` (Text)
  - `is_read` (Boolean, Default: False)
  - `created_at` (Timestamp)

### 9. Moderation Model
This model tracks moderation actions taken on posts or users.

- **Moderation**
  - `moderation_id` (Primary Key, Unique Identifier)
  - `moderator_id` (Foreign Key to User)
  - `action` (Enum: Ban, Unban, Delete Post, Edit Post)
  - `target_user_id` (Foreign Key to User, Nullable)
  - `target_post_id` (Foreign Key to Post, Nullable)
  - `reason` (Text)
  - `created_at` (Timestamp)

### Relationships
- A **User** can create many **Posts** (1-to-many).
- A **User** can create many **Comments** (1-to-many).
- A **Post** can have many **Comments** (1-to-many).
- A **Post** belongs to a **Category** (many-to-1).
- A **Post** can have many **Tags** through the **PostTag** model (many-to-many).
- A **User** can like many **Posts** and **Comments** (1-to-many).
- A **User** can receive many **Notifications** (1-to-many).
- A **Moderator** (User) can perform many **Moderation** actions (1-to-many).

### Considerations
- **Data Integrity**: Use foreign keys to maintain referential integrity.
- **Indexes**: Create indexes on commonly queried fields like `user_id`, `post_id`, and `created_at` for performance enhancements.
- **Security**: Ensure password hashes are securely stored and consider adding fields for password reset tokens or multi-factor authentication.

This data model provides a robust structure to support the expected functionalities of a community forum app, such as user interactions, content management, and moderation features.

# Data Model: Actual Implementation (as of 2025-06-03)

Below are the actual Mongoose models implemented in the codebase for the community forum app backend. This reflects the current JavaScript backend structure and field names/types.

### Notes
- All models use Mongoose's ObjectId for references.
- Timestamps are enabled for all models (createdAt, updatedAt where applicable).
- Some models use virtuals (e.g., Category.threadCount).
- Field names and types reflect the actual backend implementation.
