To create comprehensive Activity Duration Estimates for the Community Forum App project, we'll employ the three-point estimation technique, which uses optimistic (O), pessimistic (P), and most likely (M) estimates to calculate an expected duration (E). 

The formula for calculating the expected duration using the three-point estimation is:

\[ E = \frac{O + 4M + P}{6} \]

### Activity Duration Estimates

Here are the main activities involved in the project, along with their three-point estimates:

1. **Requirements Gathering**
   - Optimistic (O): 3 days
   - Most Likely (M): 5 days
   - Pessimistic (P): 7 days
   - **Expected Duration (E)**: 
     \[
     E = \frac{3 + 4(5) + 7}{6} = \frac{3 + 20 + 7}{6} = \frac{30}{6} = 5 \text{ days}
     \]

2. **Design UI/UX**
   - Optimistic (O): 4 days
   - Most Likely (M): 6 days
   - Pessimistic (P): 10 days
   - **Expected Duration (E)**: 
     \[
     E = \frac{4 + 4(6) + 10}{6} = \frac{4 + 24 + 10}{6} = \frac{38}{6} \approx 6.33 \text{ days} \text{ (rounded to 7 days)}
     \]

3. **Backend Development**
   - Optimistic (O): 10 days
   - Most Likely (M): 15 days
   - Pessimistic (P): 25 days
   - **Expected Duration (E)**: 
     \[
     E = \frac{10 + 4(15) + 25}{6} = \frac{10 + 60 + 25}{6} = \frac{95}{6} \approx 15.83 \text{ days} \text{ (rounded to 16 days)}
     \]

4. **Frontend Development**
   - Optimistic (O): 8 days
   - Most Likely (M): 12 days
   - Pessimistic (P): 20 days
   - **Expected Duration (E)**: 
     \[
     E = \frac{8 + 4(12) + 20}{6} = \frac{8 + 48 + 20}{6} = \frac{76}{6} \approx 12.67 \text{ days} \text{ (rounded to 13 days)}
     \]

5. **Testing**
   - Optimistic (O): 5 days
   - Most Likely (M): 10 days
   - Pessimistic (P): 15 days
   - **Expected Duration (E)**: 
     \[
     E = \frac{5 + 4(10) + 15}{6} = \frac{5 + 40 + 15}{6} = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ days}
     \]

6. **Deployment**
   - Optimistic (O): 2 days
   - Most Likely (M): 3 days
   - Pessimistic (P): 5 days
   - **Expected Duration (E)**: 
     \[
     E = \frac{2 + 4(3) + 5}{6} = \frac{2 + 12 + 5}{6} = \frac{19}{6} \approx 3.17 \text{ days} \text{ (rounded to 3 days)}
     \]

7. **Post-Deployment Support**
   - Optimistic (O): 1 day
   - Most Likely (M): 3 days
   - Pessimistic (P): 7 days
   - **Expected Duration (E)**: 
     \[
     E = \frac{1 + 4(3) + 7}{6} = \frac{1 + 12 + 7}{6} = \frac{20}{6} \approx 3.33 \text{ days} \text{ (rounded to 3 days)}
     \]
