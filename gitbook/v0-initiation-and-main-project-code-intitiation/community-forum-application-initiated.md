#### Community Forum Application

I'll create a comprehensive community forum application with user authentication, discussion forums, and profile management. This will include a clean, responsive design using shadcn/ui components.

I've created a comprehensive Community Forum application with all the essential features for a modern discussion platform. The application includes:

### Key Features

1. **Home Page**: Showcases forum categories, trending discussions, and recent activity
2. **Forums Section**: Organized by categories with listing pages and individual thread views
3. **User Profiles**: Personalized account pages with activity tracking and settings
4. **Authentication**: Complete login and registration flows
5. **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on mobile and desktop devices

### Technical Implementation

* Built with Next.js App Router and React
* Uses shadcn/ui components for a clean, modern UI
* Implements responsive layouts with Tailwind CSS
* Features client-side interactivity for thread discussions and user profiles
* Includes dark/light theme toggle functionality

The application structure follows best practices with separate components for reusability and maintainability. The forum data is currently mocked but could easily be connected to a database in a production environment.
