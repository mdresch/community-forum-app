### Member Profile Page

I've created a comprehensive member profile page that showcases detailed information about community members when clicked from the directory.

#### Key Features

**Rich Profile Information**

* **Detailed Header**: Profile picture, name, username, role, and online status
* **Bio & Contact**: Personal bio, location, website, and trust level
* **Statistics Overview**: Posts count, reputation score, and followers at a glance
* **Reputation Progress**: Visual indicator of progress toward the next reputation level
* **Top Badges**: Quick view of the member's most notable achievements

**Interactive Profile Actions**

* **Follow/Unfollow**: Toggle to follow members and receive updates about their activity
* **Direct Messaging**: Send private messages to connect with community members
* **Profile Sharing**: Share member profiles with others
* **Reporting**: Report inappropriate behavior when necessary

**Comprehensive Content Tabs**

* **Activity Feed**: Chronological display of the member's recent forum activity
* **Threads Started**: List of discussions the member has initiated
* **Badges & Achievements**: Complete collection of earned recognitions
* **Reputation History**: Detailed breakdown of reputation sources and changes

**Reputation Analytics**

* **Distribution Visualization**: See where reputation points come from
* **Time-Based Metrics**: Track reputation growth over different time periods
* **Event History**: Detailed log of individual reputation changes
* **Filtering Options**: View positive, negative, or badge-related reputation events

#### Implementation Details

The profile page uses dynamic routing based on username, making each profile accessible via a clean URL structure. The design is fully responsive, adapting to all screen sizes while maintaining a clean, organized layout.

The mock data demonstrates a variety of user types (admin, moderator, elite member) with different levels of activity and achievements. In a production environment, this would connect to your user database to display real member information.
