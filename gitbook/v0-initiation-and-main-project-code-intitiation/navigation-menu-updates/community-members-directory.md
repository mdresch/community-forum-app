### Community Members Directory

I've created a comprehensive members directory that showcases your community's users with detailed profile information and powerful browsing tools.

#### Key Features

**Rich Member Cards**

* **Visual Profile Cards**: Each member is displayed with their avatar, name, username, and role
* **Status Indicators**: See who's currently online with status indicators
* **Reputation & Activity**: View reputation scores, post counts, and join dates at a glance
* **Badge Showcase**: Display earned badges and achievements
* **Location & Bio**: Get to know members with their location and short bio
* **Last Activity**: See when members were last active on the forum

**Powerful Filtering & Sorting**

* **Role-Based Filtering**: Quickly find admins, moderators, elite members, or regular users
* **Online Status Filter**: Toggle to show only currently active members
* **Multiple Sorting Options**: Sort by reputation, post count, join date, or alphabetically
* **Full-Text Search**: Search across names, usernames, and bios to find specific members

**Responsive Design**

* **Grid Layout**: Responsive grid that adapts from 1 to 4 columns based on screen size
* **Mobile-Friendly Controls**: All filters and search tools work well on small screens
* **Optimized Card Design**: Member cards remain readable and useful at all screen sizes

**Pagination System**

* **Smart Pagination**: Dynamically shows relevant page numbers based on current position
* **Efficient Loading**: Only loads a subset of members at a time for better performance
* **Accessible Controls**: Fully keyboard navigable with proper ARIA labels

#### Implementation Details

The directory uses mock data for demonstration, but it's designed to easily connect to your backend API. The filtering, sorting, and pagination logic is all implemented on the client side for a smooth, responsive user experience.

The design maintains consistency with your existing forum aesthetic while providing a dedicated space for community discovery and connection.
