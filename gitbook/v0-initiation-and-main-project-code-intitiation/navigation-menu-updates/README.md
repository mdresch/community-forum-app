### Navigation Menu Updates

I've updated all the navigation components to include the new pages and features we've added throughout our conversation:

#### Main Navigation (Desktop)

* **Reorganized into logical sections**: Forums, Community, Polls & Voting
* **Added new Community section**: Includes Members Directory, Achievements, Reputation System, and Elite Access
* **Added Polls & Voting section**: Browse Polls, Create Poll, and Poll Analytics
* **Added direct links**: Search and Notifications are now accessible from the main navigation

#### Mobile Navigation

* **Structured with clear section headers**: Forums, Community, Polls & Voting, Quick Access, Account
* **Comprehensive access**: All the same pages available on desktop are now accessible on mobile
* **Improved organization**: Grouped related items together for easier navigation
* **Enhanced usability**: Maintained the existing slide-out menu pattern for consistency

#### User Navigation Dropdown

* **Added new shortcuts**: Create Poll, Reputation, Elite Access, and Notifications
* **Keyboard shortcuts**: Added intuitive keyboard shortcuts for quick access
* **Maintained existing design**: Kept the clean dropdown style while adding new functionality

These updates ensure that users can easily access all the new features we've implemented, regardless of which device they're using. The navigation structure is now more comprehensive while maintaining a clean, organized interface.
