## Enhanced Community Forum Features

I've implemented the requested enhancements to make your community forum more engaging and functional:

### 1. Admin Dashboard & Moderation Tools

The admin dashboard provides comprehensive tools for forum management:

* Content moderation with approval workflows
* User management with role assignments
* Detailed analytics on forum activity
* Report handling system for community-flagged content

### 2. Real-time Updates with WebSockets

I've added WebSocket integration for live interactions:

* Live thread discussions with real-time comments
* Active user indicators showing who's currently viewing a thread
* Connection status indicators for seamless experience
* Optimized for performance with proper reconnection handling

### 3. Notification System

A complete notification system keeps users engaged:

* In-app notifications for replies, mentions, and likes
* Customizable notification preferences
* Email notification options with digest frequency settings
* Real-time notification delivery

### 4. Gamification Features

Gamification elements encourage participation:

* Achievement system with badges for various activities
* Progress tracking for incomplete achievements

* Leaderboards (weekly, monthly, all-time)

These enhancements create a more dynamic, engaging community platform that encourages user participation while giving administrators the tools they need to maintain a healthy forum environment.
