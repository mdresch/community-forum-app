### Bookmarks Management System

I've created a comprehensive bookmarks management system that allows users to save, organize, and maintain references to content across your community forum.

#### Key Features

**Powerful Organization Tools**

* **Collections System**: Create custom collections to organize bookmarks by topic or purpose
* **Default "Saved Items" Collection**: All bookmarks are automatically saved here if not assigned elsewhere
* **Tabbed Interface**: Easily switch between collections with a clean, intuitive tab system
* **Search Functionality**: Quickly find bookmarks with full-text search across titles, excerpts, notes, and tags

**Rich Bookmark Management**

* **Detailed Bookmark Cards**: View comprehensive information about each saved item
* **Custom Notes**: Add personal notes to bookmarks for future reference
* **Tagging System**: Categorize bookmarks with custom tags for better organization
* **Bulk Actions**: Select multiple bookmarks to move or delete them together
* **Move Between Collections**: Easily reorganize bookmarks across different collections

**User-Friendly Interface**

* **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on all device sizes
* **Visual Type Indicators**: Icons show whether a bookmark is a thread, poll, user profile, or other content
* **Context Menus**: Quick access to actions through dropdown menus
* **Empty States**: Helpful guidance when collections are empty
* **Confirmation Dialogs**: Prevent accidental deletion of bookmarks

#### Implementation Details

The bookmarks system uses client-side state management for the demo, but it's designed to easily connect to your backend API. The collections and bookmarks are stored with a clear data structure that can be persisted to a database.

The UI maintains consistency with your existing forum aesthetic while providing dedicated tools for bookmark management. All components are fully accessible and keyboard navigable.
