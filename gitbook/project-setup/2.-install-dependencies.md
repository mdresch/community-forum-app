# 2. Install Dependencies

This project uses a root package.json with a script to install dependencies for both the client and server.

From the **root** directory (community-forum-app):

```
npm run install-all
```

This command will:

* Install dependencies for the root project (mainly concurrently).
* Navigate into the server directory and run npm install.
* Navigate into the client directory and run npm install.

If npm run install-all gives you issues for any reason, you can install them manually:

```
# In the root directory (community-forum-app)
npm install

# Install server dependencies
cd server
npm install
cd ..

# Install client dependencies
cd client
npm install
cd ..
```
